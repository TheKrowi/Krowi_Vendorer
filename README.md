Vendorer helps you manage your inventory when selling to vendors by giving you control over what to sell and what to keep.

### Features
- **Ignore List**: Add items you never want to sell so they're always protected.
- **Junk List**: Add items you always want to sell for quick cleanup.
- **Auto Sell Rules**: Create powerful custom rules to automatically sell items based on:
  - Item name
  - Item quality (poor, common, uncommon, etc.)
  - Item type (armor, weapons, consumables, etc.)
  - Inventory type (head, chest, legs, etc.)
  - And many more criteria
- **Auto Repair**: Automatically repair your gear when visiting a vendor who can repair.
  - Choose to repair using your guild bank funds (if available)
  - Optional chat messages to keep track of repair costs
- **Easy Access**: Options available via minimap icon or addon compartment.
- **Profile Support**: Different settings for different characters or share settings across characters.

### Compatibility
- Works with Krowi's Extended Vendor UI ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/krowi-extended-vendor-ui) | [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/krowi-extended-vendor-ui)) for the best experience
- Also works standalone with the default World of Warcraft vendor interface
